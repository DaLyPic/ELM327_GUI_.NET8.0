Major change was executed. The former "Auto adatai" button was renamed to "VIN dekódolás". VIN decoding completely new function was added to this project as the 10th functionality of ELM327_GUI project. The NHTSA Standalone database ("vPICList_lite_2025_10.bak.zip" updated on 10/18/2025, file size: 176 MB) was used for this. The former mentioned .bak file was restored in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio version 21 that was used as local "SQL server". GUI has also undergone major changes. Main picture was removed due to copyright protection purposes and replaced with free picture. Another two free pictures were added. At the project opening an animated Splashscreen was added. ListBox was removed from Grid.Row="2" Grid.Column="1" and also color changed back to original one.
